# Clarification Needed

The current problem statement only specifies which directories to use (`frontendpart/interviewpage` for frontend and `backend` for backend) but does not specify what changes or implementations are needed.

To proceed, we need more information about:
1. What specific functionality needs to be implemented or modified
2. What issues need to be fixed (if any)
3. What new features need to be added (if any)

Currently visible components and structure:
- Frontend (frontendpart/interviewpage):
  - Interview related components (InterviewPage.jsx, InterviewerView.jsx)
  - Code editor component
  - Video call functionality
  - Chat functionality
- Backend (backend):
  - Express.js server
  - Various routes (call, email, interview, auth, etc.)
  - Socket.io integration

Please provide more specific requirements about what needs to be changed or implemented in these directories.
